  <h2>Physical Palace Place</h2>
    I play baseball at Juniata College and am studying Biology to become a physical therapist. I plan on going onto doctorate school to get my doctorates degree in Physical therapy.
        I have been to many physical therapy appointments since I've been playing baseball for my back, shoulder, and elbow. I really strive and enjoy helping others and seeing others
        get healthy. I also enjoy coding in my free time and making little programs to enjoy.
